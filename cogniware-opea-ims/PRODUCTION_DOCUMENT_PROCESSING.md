## 🚀 How It Works

### 1. Document Upload
```bash
POST http://localhost:8090/api/documents/upload
Content-Type: multipart/form-data

file: [Your PDF/DOCX/etc file]
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "document_name": "TheForeignMarriageAct1969.pdf",
  "file_size": 301205,
  "file_type": ".pdf",
